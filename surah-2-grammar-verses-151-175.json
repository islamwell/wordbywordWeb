The pattern 'ṣābir' means 'one who is patient' - it's describing their character. The 'īn' ending makes it plural and genitive (due to 'ma'a'). So Allah promises: if you are among 'aṣ-ṣābirīn' (the patient ones), then Allah is WITH YOU! This isn't temporary - 'ṣābirīn' describes people whose CHARACTERISTIC is patience. They don't just have sabr once - they are PATIENT PEOPLE. That's why Allah's companionship is with them - their consistent sabr earns consistent divine support. Beautiful motivation: be among aṣ-ṣābirīn, and you'll have Allah's ma'iyyah (His being with you)!"
